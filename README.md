Check out my new tool designed to explore complicated (mostly) continuous probability distributions.

TODO:
Change convergence size to be max depth of tree
Allow for variable value of "infinity" (max sample value)
Fix mobile formatting... 
Maybe add a line on the cdf chart showing the cdf of the generated data.

Also, uniform and discrete distributions. (uniform is a must have. Discrete may just be ignored. )
